<p>We have seen the value of Likes from the S1 filing of Facebook just last week. Facebook has built a multibillion dollar business by understanding what their users say they like, but more importantly they have incorporated Verbs in order to add more context to their users&#8217; status updates.</p>

<p>The reason for them doing this is simple really. You can talk about what you Like and think all day but it simply doesn&#8217;t mean you will act on it. What is a much better indicator of possible behavior is a user&#8217;s prior behavior. Being able to understand the context of what users are doing will allow advertisers to target users even more accurately.</p>

<p>That is because if you listen to a certain type of music or watch a certain genre of movies frequently, chances are high that you would listen to the same type of music or watch the same genre of movie. Same goes for most lifestyle activities we engage in. Personal preferences are best understood through past behavior.</p>

<p>Activity tracking will be the future and privacy will be compromised. However, in a web system where the social layer drives increasing amount of activity, it is bound to happen.</p>

<p>Activity tracking is not entirely a bad thing however because it provides metrics that provide deeper insights into human behavior and will help us make progress as a species.</p>

<p>In fact, if we are able to create a gamified tracking system that intrinsically rewards users, we will be able to solve much bigger real world problems together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People have often advocated starting a new business during my own free time while I&#8217;m holding a full time job before jumping into it. Sure, it means stability and lower risks since I would probably be able to determine whether the business idea will work out.</p>

<p>However, the fact is that a very important aspect of building a good business is actually the founders&#8217; ability to maintain a laser sharp focus on their vision and being able to execute the steps required to reach that vision.</p>

<p>Flow is a state of extremely high focus during an activity and it takes time to get into that state. Every time we switch from one activity to another, we break the flow and our productivity takes a huge beating. Activities that require high focus should be done with as little disturbance as possible.</p>

<p>A day job acts as a daily disturbance to an activity you should be fully committed to and focused on. While holding a day job now, I spend 3 hours a day traveling and 9 hours at the office (sometimes more). That is a total of 12+ hours a day spent not working on my product. Most of my energy get expended during those 12 hours as well and I reach home battered and depleted.</p>

<p>How can I convince the world that I believe in my vision if I am unwilling to dive into it and place my full commitment and focus on the business?</p>

<p>If you are starting a business right now while also working a full time job, stop kidding yourself. You are moving much slower than you should be.</p>

<p>MPAA should stop being such a troll. Isn&#8217;t this what SOPA / PIPA was for? So big organizations can silence people but no one can silence the big organizations?</p>

<p>Hacking major sites like yours may not be the best course of action but it has certainly shown the double standards.</p>

<h4>Full Statement from the MPAA:</h4>

<p>&#8220;Our website and many others, including the Department of Justice, were attacked today and the hacker group Anonymous is claiming responsibility for the attacks. We are working with law enforcement authorities to identify those responsible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some groups believe that speech or ideas that they disagree with should be silenced. This could not be more wrong. No matter the point of view, everyone has a right to be heard.</p>

<p>The motion picture and television industry has always been a strong supporter of free speech. We strongly condemn any attempts to silence any groups or individuals.</p>

<p>The Internet is home to creativity, innovation and free speech. We want to keep it that way. Protecting copyrights and protecting free speech go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reflection is the first step for improvement. Without spending time to figure out what to learn and improve on, we fall into the danger of stagnation. This may come a little late but it must be done. Let&#8217;s take a look back at my 2011.</p>

<h3>1. Toy with idea of Gamification</h3>

<p>It was the beginning of a new year. Being an RPG lover, I started imagining living my life as if it was an RPG, gaining levels while completing quests and achievements.</p>

<p>I was sure it was a novel idea but some research proved that it was not. SCVNGR was the biggest real life Gamification service at that time.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I wanted to marry Gamification with instagram&#8217;s stickiness as an app. Sourcing for funding was a tough matter at that time and I was unsure how to move the idea forward. It probably sucked anyway, as all who have experience in tech startups would tell you about your initial idea.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: Fund raising is a difficult process for early stage ideas and first time founders. Get a working prototype out!</p>

<h3>2. Account executive work</h3>

<p>I continued my work as an account executive and learned a lot about customer service and project management, though project management was mostly planning what the client wanted.</p>

<p>During this time, I also discovered my love for coding as I made amendments to my developers&#8217; code due to tight timelines.</p>

<p>I loved building things. I knew this subconsciously but I was afraid of failing as I never had prior experience, but I took my first step towards development by asking for a switch of department.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: If you want something, dare to ask for it. If you never take that step, no one can help you get what you want.</p>

<h3>3. Hunger to be a web developer</h3>

<p>I was filled with the hunger to develop for the web and devoured knowledge of HTML5 &amp; CSS3 like a famished vulture. I began picking up jQuery for how easy it was to add interaction to sites and I slowly transitioned into the role of a web developer.</p>

<p>I had little time to sleep as I juggled the extra load of learning but I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: Coding is a creative and iterative process. It takes awhile to get the code right sometimes but the winning sensation is immensely gratifying.</p>

<p>Also, coder&#8217;s block is extremely dangerous and causes me to visit Hacker News more times than I should.</p>

<h3>4. Founder Institute</h3>

<p>During the last quarter of 2011, I received news that I got accepted into Fall 2011&#8217;s SG FI batch. I jumped on the opportunity with only the slightest of hesitation. (ok, just a bit of research on Quora before I paid the course fees.)</p>

<p>Q4 of 2011 would prove to be the toughest period of 2011 for me as I juggled the course schedule, the assignments and an intensive work schedule on my day job doing web development. Few hours of sleep with lots of late night discussions, brainstorming and coding became the norm.</p>

<p>It is paying off now as I am about to start working on Questified full time, taking the full plunge into entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Founder Institute has been the forceful helping hand that&#8217;s pushing my non-functioning aircraft off the edge. I am all ready to start the sprint to make sure the air craft can fly before it hits the ground.</p>

<h3>Social as a layer</h3>

<p>There has been debate about whether we are at the peak of the social web due to the saturation of social usage.</p>

<p>The truth is that those who think there will be a peak and a slump do not understand social for what it is. As the Zuck would put it: Social is not an app, it is a layer upon the web.</p>

<p>Sure, the web can be served as it is, but social makes it better in a way that is natural to human tendencies and delight. It feeds on mankind&#8217;s tendencies to share things that interests them, thus the power of the &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Tweet&#8221; buttons. People don&#8217;t need to think about it. It is part of who they are.</p>

<p>A layer doesn&#8217;t make people think. If you are a good designer, you know how important it is to not make users think.</p>

<h3>Gamification as a layer</h3>

<p>I am a web developer and web development is a gamified process where I turn my vision or a mock up into a site. I code it, I click refresh in anticipation of the results and I get to see whether the results match my intended goal. There is constant feedback on my efforts through the refresh button, allowing me to fail and succeed rapidly until I reach the final goal.</p>

<p>And this process is a natural part of the human psych. When we participate in activities we are interested in, we have goals we want to meet, usually related to the mastery of the subject. The best way to meet the goals is to work on it by breaking down the steps into measurable tasks and obtaining feedback on your performance as you complete each task.</p>

<p>A game is defined by 4 traits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Voluntary Participation</li>
</ol>


<p>It may not be obvious but our life is like a game. We make multiple interesting decisions everyday in order to reach our goals and there are rules that create boundaries to what we can or cannot do to reach them. However, we fail see our lives as game like because of the lack of something that connects the dots for us. Most parts of our lives, we go through them without systematic feedback on our decisions and actions.</p>

<p>Gamification will help solve this lack of feedback. Gamification will be a layer upon our lives and it will be natural to us humans without us having to think about it.</p>

<p>P.S. I don&#8217;t like the word gamification either but the industry seems to have settled on it as the defacto term.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Always be prepared with 3 elevator pitch for your startup.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the lesson I learned just 2 days ago. For the past month, I&#8217;ve prepared myself with 2 elevator pitches, one structured to be generic and lasted at most 30s and the other structured to be more specific, with more detail on what the startup actually does and would last from 3 - 5 mins.</p>

<p>When I was asked to give an impromptu 1 min pitch, I was stumped. I went up and tried to fit in as much detail as I could from the longer pitch but I ran over time and what I managed to ramble turned out to be incoherent because I didn&#8217;t manage to get to the point within the minute. That made me realize the importance of the 1 min pitch that I was not prepared for.</p>

<p>I will first outline the 2 pitches I was prepared for:</p>

<ol>
<li>The 30s pitch</li>
<li>The 3-5min pitch</li>
</ol>


<h3>The 30s Elevator Pitch</h3>

<p>The usage of this pitch is pretty clear and straightforward. It&#8217;s for occasions when you have a chance to introduce yourself and what you do but have very limited time with the person you are pitching.</p>

<p>This pitch will be generic but should generate enough interest so the person you pitch is willing to follow up or at the very least, try your product.</p>

<p>The best guide for this I have come across is Adeo Ressi&#8217;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/16447520">Madlibs for Pitching</a> and this is the template to follow:</p>

<p>My company, (company name)<br/>
is developing (a defined offering)<br/>
to help (a target audience)<br/>
(solve a problem)<br/>
(with secret sauce)</p>

<p>Fill in the above and you have a pitch fit for anywhere between 20s to 30s.</p>

<h3>The 3 - 5 min Pitch</h3>

<p>This pitch will require much more detail. And this is the structure that I followed to create my pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start off with an introduction of yourself and the 30s pitch.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Talk about your target market and why they will use your solution.</li>
<li>Talk about your competitors and how you will differentiate.</li>
<li>Talk about your revenue model.</li>
<li>Talk about your team and why your team is the best fit to do this.</li>
<li>Talk about what phase you are in and what you need. (eg. Funding? Advice?)</li>
</ol>


<p>There will be quite an amount of detail that you should have done thorough research on, and these are important details that people need to know in order to be truly interested in your business whether they are investors or potential employees. Make sure you know all these information at the tip of your fingers.</p>

<h3>The 1 min Pitch</h3>

<p>There will be times when you will need to give details of your business so that the main points of the business gets across but you have limited time to impress.</p>

<p>This is where the 1 min pitch comes in. Time to put your tweeting skills to use. Be interesting and be concise. Your main goal here is to solicit comments and feedback on top of building interest in what you do.</p>

<p>What does the person you are pitching absolutely has to know in order to understand enough of your business to be able to give valuable feedback?</p>

<p>Here is the structure that I followed to create my 1 min pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduce yourself and your company.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>How do you make money?</li>
<li>What do you need from the person you are pitching?</li>
</ol>


<p>The core of this pitch lies in your company&#8217;s solution to the problem described. Get this wrong and be prepared to entertain a befuddled audience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to migrate the blog from Wordpress over to a Jekyll/Octopress blogging framework for tech geeks but haven&#8217;t really had the time with my crazy schedules.</p>

<p>And then I realized it doesn&#8217;t actually take too much time to set Octopress up and deploy, especially if you are deploying to Github pages or Heroku.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to migrate from Wordpress as well, here&#8217;s an outline of the steps I took:</p>

<h4>1. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.2+ and Clone Octopress</h4>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>cd octopress</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>2. Install dependencies and install the default Ocotpress theme</h4>

<p>bundle install
rake install</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>If you want a Github page with subdomain called username/organization, set up a Github repository like `username.github.com` or `organization.github.com`

<p>rake setup_github_pages</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft&#8217;s announcement that plug ins will not be supported in the METRO version of IE10 can be important news, depending on whether or not you believe that METRO will be the UI of the future. The desktop view version of IE10 will
continue to support Flash.</p>

<p>According to their research, 62% of video sites have some form of HTML5 fallback, however we can still be quite sure that a large percentage of sites still use Flash for myriad purposes. One of which is advertising and this will be greatly affected when browsers and devices continuously drops support for Flash, and is likely to happen in the near future judging from recent sentiments. Most advertisements are now done in Flash for the effects that can be created easily using Adobe&#8217;s Flash suite.</p>

<p>The industry will have to step up fast and switch to HTML5 and Javascript for development in the next few years. However, as browsers without plugin support becomes mainstream, I can imagine developers and clients having to spend more time and money on creating both Flash versions and HTML fallback of their
creations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it seems like the end of an era is nigh upon us. Web sites and content that load quickly and isn&#8217;t cumbersome should be the focus. The giants have spoken.</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting on you a long time now, <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_1_release_notes.html">Rails 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>Now now, can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the latest version of <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 in Action</a> and dig my head into Rails 3.1 documentation as well.</p>

<p>I guess my plan to complete Dragon Age : Origins is in ashes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Your job scope requires you to sit behind a huge monitor and bury yourself in code. That basically means you build things, in CODE. And what the code renders, is ART. Interactive art and possibly the most modern, most advanced art form.</p>

<p>As developers, we need to be very talkative about the project we are working on.</p>

<h3>Talk to relevant stakeholders.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your client, your managers, your peers, tell them what you are doing, solicit feedback.</li>
<li>Tell them your vision.</li>
<li>Tell them what you think would work or won&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait till the end to start talking.</li>
<li>Keep communicating. Keep telling.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Talk to other developers.</h3>

<p>Again, tell them what you are doing.
* What technology you are using.
* What language?
* What kind of workflow?
* What have you learned?
* What insights do others have to help improve on the project?</p>

<p>Talk.</p>

<h3>Talk to the public.</h3>

<p>You are Working on an amazing thing. Share what you are doing. Do a show n tell and mostly show how much you love the art you produced.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you love it?</li>
<li>Was it the process?</li>
<li>The experimental technology you used?</li>
<li>The people/brand/product behind it?</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t be a cubicle drone developer. Be a show and tell developer.</p></blockquote>
