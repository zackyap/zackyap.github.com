'Unfortunately, some groups believe that speech or ideas that they disagree with should be silenced. This could not be more wrong. No matter the point of view, everyone has a right to be heard."  -- MPAA

MPAA should stop being such a troll. Isn't this what SOPA / PIPA was for? So big organizations can silence people but no one can silence the big organizations?

Hacking major sites like yours may not be the best course of action but it has certainly shown the double standards.


#### Full Statement from the MPAA:

"Our website and many others, including the Department of Justice, were attacked today and the hacker group Anonymous is claiming responsibility for the attacks. We are working with law enforcement authorities to identify those responsible.  

Unfortunately, some groups believe that speech or ideas that they disagree with should be silenced. This could not be more wrong. No matter the point of view, everyone has a right to be heard.

The motion picture and television industry has always been a strong supporter of free speech. We strongly condemn any attempts to silence any groups or individuals.      

The Internet is home to creativity, innovation and free speech. We want to keep it that way. Protecting copyrights and protecting free speech go hand in hand."
