I looked at Coffeescript code and loved the neatness and cleanliness of it. So
I kept wondering why I read about backlash when it was announced as the
standard for Rails 3.1. I did a bit of research and realized that most
developers didn't want to make big changes to their boiler templates or come
up with new ones and opting out through the gemfile was not intuitive. (Or at
least these were some of the arguments)

The other was that new people learning Rails would be confused. This I
definitely do not agree with because the way that Coffeescript translates to
Javascript looks pretty intuitive and the language is easy for new learners to
read and understand. I don't think it is going to be a barrier for newbies.

I personally like it. :)
