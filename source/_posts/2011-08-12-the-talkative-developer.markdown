Your job scope requires you to sit behind a huge monitor and bury yourself in
code. That basically means you build things, in CODE. And what the code
renders, is ART. Interactive art and possibly the most modern, most advanced
art form.

As developers, we need to be very talkative about the project we are working
on.

### Talk to relevant stakeholders.

Your client, your managers, your peers, tell them what you are doing, solicit
feedback.

Tell them your vision.

Tell them what you think would work or won't.

Don't wait till the end to start talking.

Keep communicating. Keep telling.

### Talk to other developers.

Again, tell them what you are doing.

What technology you are using.

What language?

What kind of workflow?

What have you learned?

What insights do others have to help improve on the project?

Talk.

### Talk to the public.

You are Working on an amazing thing.Â Share what you are doing. Do a show n
tell and mostly show how much you love the art you produced.

Why do you love it?

Was it the process?

The experimental technology you used?

The people/brand/product behind it?

Don't be a cubicle drone developer. Be a show and tell developer.
