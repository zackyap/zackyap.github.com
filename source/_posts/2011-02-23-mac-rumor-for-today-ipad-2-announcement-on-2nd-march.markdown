The latest news is that March 2nd's Apple event will be for the announcement
of this year's iPad. Of course, there are also other rumors that [this won't
be the only release of iPad for the
year](http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/09/ipad-3/), which means that iPad 3 (or
iPad 2.5) will also be released later this year.

This rendition of the iPad is rumored to be faster, includes front and back
cam and comes with high def screen.

Will definitely be up to look at Live Updates on March 2nd night.
