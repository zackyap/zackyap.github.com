I happened across [this new web app](http://www.42goals.com) and through looking at the UI, I know that if I worked on the idea, this would have been what it is.

At its core, it is a goal tracking app where you set up habits that you would like to cultivate and goals you want to achieve. On a daily basis, you would make updates to the app to indicate whether you have achieved your goal.

Initial quick thoughts on this app:

  1. It can still be made simpler (simplify the view, really)
  2. <del>This would be much better on mobile so that users update on the go</del> (edit: realized they have a mobile version)
  3. Statistics and graphs need to be easy for layman use
