    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft's announcement that plug ins will not be supported in the METRO version of IE10 can be important news, depending on whether or not you believe that METRO will be the UI of the future. The desktop view version of IE10 will
continue to support Flash.</p>

<p>According to their research, 62% of video sites have some form of HTML5 fallback, however we can still be quite sure that a large percentage of sites still use Flash for myriad purposes. One of which is advertising and this will be greatly affected when browsers and devices continuously drops support for Flash, and is likely to happen in the near future judging from recent sentiments. Most advertisements are now done in Flash for the effects that can be created easily using Adobe's Flash suite.</p>

<p>The industry will have to step up fast and switch to HTML5 and Javascript for development in the next few years. However, as browsers without plugin support becomes mainstream, I can imagine developers and clients having to spend more time and money on creating both Flash versions and HTML fallback of their
creations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it seems like the end of an era is nigh upon us. Web sites and content that load quickly and isn't cumbersome should be the focus. The giants have spoken.</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I've been waiting on you a long time now, <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_1_release_notes.html">Rails 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>Now now, can't wait to get my hands on the latest version of <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 in Action</a> and dig my head into Rails 3.1 documentation as well.</p>

<p>I guess my plan to complete Dragon Age : Origins is in ashes.</p>

    <id>http://zackyap.github.com/blog/2011/06/03/twitter-follow-google-1-and-the-other-buttons</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has launched the “Follow” button.</p>

<p>Using one of our "favourite" celebrities as example, clicking on it brings up a pop-up page that allows you to follow a site's primary account. (I’m still trying to get the Baby Baby tune out of my head… oh wait… is that girl trying to **** his ear? Damn his twitter page is supposed to be PG!)</p>

<p>The Follow button can and probably will be a new standard button to be used on
campaigns with their dedicated Twitter accounts.</p>

<p>Google’s +1 button is launched as well, which will probably be another standard for digital campaigns and in fact almost most sites will need this due to the possible effects on search ranking.</p>

<p>So now, 5 buttons are important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Twitter Tweet</li>
<li>Twitter Follow</li>
<li>Google +1</li>
<li>Facebook Like</li>
<li>Facebook Recommend</li>
</ol>


<p>Twitter Tweet is important more on a content basis.</p>

<p>Twitter Follow is important for a specific account that belongs to the site. (Campaign account? Brand account?)</p>

<p>Facebook Like/Recommend are pretty well rounded. (Can be for content / site)</p>

<p>Google +1 would be almost everywhere because of effect on search ranking.</p>

<p>What other buttons will come and will future websites be a smorgasbord of all kinds of buttons? I guess for gamers that love Zynga games, that'll be a big welcome since they love clicking. Non-stop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is the perfect example, showing us how difficult it is to get that one product right that will rake in the cash like no tomorrow. Google has developed tons of products as the internet giant it is but its Search and Word Ads are still its main cash cow.</p>

<p>Despite all the innovation one can churn out, it is just that difficult to know what a market would pick up on at a certain time. What I mean to say is that getting that right product fit actually requires a percentage of luck.</p>

<p>Whether you are using the lean startup methodology or the stealth mode mega-launch, the element of luck is there. Lean startup probably helps make sure you at least have a product that someone will be using, but it definitely cannot guarantee that you will grow big.</p>

<p>No one can know for sure what the next big thing is. But like poker, in the lottery of tech startups you just gotta start building for that ticket. Being good multiplies your chances of course.</p>
