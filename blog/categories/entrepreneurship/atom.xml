    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Met a friend who's been running a business for awhile. He looked at me and said, "Heard you're doing a startup for the first time. Congratulations, but be warned that the first year will be all about self discovery."</p>

<p>It is now my 4th day of working on my startup full time and I get what he's talking about. It probably won't be just a one year thing.</p>

<p>Nothing you have ever done will prepare you as a first time founder for the amount of introspection and self reflection you will do because you are constantly making decisions. And you'd be lying if you say you always know you are making the best choice.</p>

<p>That is probably why so many of us turn to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and other startup blogs to seek crowdsourced wisdom from people who think they've got it right.</p>

<p>The truth is that we will almost never have a damned clue over whether our decisions are the best but we can definitely wish that they lead to the best outcome.</p>

<p>What we can do for ourselves is to make decisions in a lean and agile manner just like how we want to run our startups. Early on, make decisions based on your hunch and keep iterating depending on the results.</p>

<p>Be flexible and be smart about it. We are in the school of hard knocks and there's no way around getting hurt in the process of starting a company. We just need to keep optimizing and learning.</p>

<p>Good game and good luck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People have often advocated starting a new business during my own free time while I'm holding a full time job before jumping into it. Sure, it means stability and lower risks since I would probably be able to determine whether the business idea will work out.</p>

<p>However, the fact is that a very important aspect of building a good business is actually the founders' ability to maintain a laser sharp focus on their vision and being able to execute the steps required to reach that vision.</p>

<p>Flow is a state of extremely high focus during an activity and it takes time to get into that state. Every time we switch from one activity to another, we break the flow and our productivity takes a huge beating. Activities that require high focus should be done with as little disturbance as possible.</p>

<p>A day job acts as a daily disturbance to an activity you should be fully committed to and focused on. While holding a day job now, I spend 3 hours a day traveling and 9 hours at the office (sometimes more). That is a total of 12+ hours a day spent not working on my product. Most of my energy get expended during those 12 hours as well and I reach home battered and depleted.</p>

<p>How can I convince the world that I believe in my vision if I am unwilling to dive into it and place my full commitment and focus on the business?</p>

<p>If you are starting a business right now while also working a full time job, stop kidding yourself. You are moving much slower than you should be.</p>
