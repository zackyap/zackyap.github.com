<p>MPAA should stop being such a troll. Isn&#8217;t this what SOPA / PIPA was for? So big organizations can silence people but no one can silence the big organizations?</p>

<p>Hacking major sites like yours may not be the best course of action but it has certainly shown the double standards.</p>

<h4>Full Statement from the MPAA:</h4>

<p>&#8220;Our website and many others, including the Department of Justice, were attacked today and the hacker group Anonymous is claiming responsibility for the attacks. We are working with law enforcement authorities to identify those responsible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some groups believe that speech or ideas that they disagree with should be silenced. This could not be more wrong. No matter the point of view, everyone has a right to be heard.</p>

<p>The motion picture and television industry has always been a strong supporter of free speech. We strongly condemn any attempts to silence any groups or individuals.</p>

<p>The Internet is home to creativity, innovation and free speech. We want to keep it that way. Protecting copyrights and protecting free speech go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Social as a layer</h3>

<p>There has been debate about whether we are at the peak of the social web due to the saturation of social usage.</p>

<p>The truth is that those who think there will be a peak and a slump do not understand social for what it is. As the Zuck would put it: Social is not an app, it is a layer upon the web.</p>

<p>Sure, the web can be served as it is, but social makes it better in a way that is natural to human tendencies and delight. It feeds on mankind&#8217;s tendencies to share things that interests them, thus the power of the &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Tweet&#8221; buttons. People don&#8217;t need to think about it. It is part of who they are.</p>

<p>A layer doesn&#8217;t make people think. If you are a good designer, you know how important it is to not make users think.</p>

<h3>Gamification as a layer</h3>

<p>I am a web developer and web development is a gamified process where I turn my vision or a mock up into a site. I code it, I click refresh in anticipation of the results and I get to see whether the results match my intended goal. There is constant feedback on my efforts through the refresh button, allowing me to fail and succeed rapidly until I reach the final goal.</p>

<p>And this process is a natural part of the human psych. When we participate in activities we are interested in, we have goals we want to meet, usually related to the mastery of the subject. The best way to meet the goals is to work on it by breaking down the steps into measurable tasks and obtaining feedback on your performance as you complete each task.</p>

<p>A game is defined by 4 traits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Voluntary Participation</li>
</ol>


<p>It may not be obvious but our life is like a game. We make multiple interesting decisions everyday in order to reach our goals and there are rules that create boundaries to what we can or cannot do to reach them. However, we fail see our lives as game like because of the lack of something that connects the dots for us. Most parts of our lives, we go through them without systematic feedback on our decisions and actions.</p>

<p>Gamification will help solve this lack of feedback. Gamification will be a layer upon our lives and it will be natural to us humans without us having to think about it.</p>

<p>P.S. I don&#8217;t like the word gamification either but the industry seems to have settled on it as the defacto term.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Always be prepared with 3 elevator pitch for your startup.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the lesson I learned just 2 days ago. For the past month, I&#8217;ve prepared myself with 2 elevator pitches, one structured to be generic and lasted at most 30s and the other structured to be more specific, with more detail on what the startup actually does and would last from 3 - 5 mins.</p>

<p>When I was asked to give an impromptu 1 min pitch, I was stumped. I went up and tried to fit in as much detail as I could from the longer pitch but I ran over time and what I managed to ramble turned out to be incoherent because I didn&#8217;t manage to get to the point within the minute. That made me realize the importance of the 1 min pitch that I was not prepared for.</p>

<p>I will first outline the 2 pitches I was prepared for:</p>

<ol>
<li>The 30s pitch</li>
<li>The 3-5min pitch</li>
</ol>


<h3>The 30s Elevator Pitch</h3>

<p>The usage of this pitch is pretty clear and straightforward. It&#8217;s for occasions when you have a chance to introduce yourself and what you do but have very limited time with the person you are pitching.</p>

<p>This pitch will be generic but should generate enough interest so the person you pitch is willing to follow up or at the very least, try your product.</p>

<p>The best guide for this I have come across is Adeo Ressi&#8217;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/16447520">Madlibs for Pitching</a> and this is the template to follow:</p>

<p>My company, (company name)<br/>
is developing (a defined offering)<br/>
to help (a target audience)<br/>
(solve a problem)<br/>
(with secret sauce)</p>

<p>Fill in the above and you have a pitch fit for anywhere between 20s to 30s.</p>

<h3>The 3 - 5 min Pitch</h3>

<p>This pitch will require much more detail. And this is the structure that I followed to create my pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start off with an introduction of yourself and the 30s pitch.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Talk about your target market and why they will use your solution.</li>
<li>Talk about your competitors and how you will differentiate.</li>
<li>Talk about your revenue model.</li>
<li>Talk about your team and why your team is the best fit to do this.</li>
<li>Talk about what phase you are in and what you need. (eg. Funding? Advice?)</li>
</ol>


<p>There will be quite an amount of detail that you should have done thorough research on, and these are important details that people need to know in order to be truly interested in your business whether they are investors or potential employees. Make sure you know all these information at the tip of your fingers.</p>

<h3>The 1 min Pitch</h3>

<p>There will be times when you will need to give details of your business so that the main points of the business gets across but you have limited time to impress.</p>

<p>This is where the 1 min pitch comes in. Time to put your tweeting skills to use. Be interesting and be concise. Your main goal here is to solicit comments and feedback on top of building interest in what you do.</p>

<p>What does the person you are pitching absolutely has to know in order to understand enough of your business to be able to give valuable feedback?</p>

<p>Here is the structure that I followed to create my 1 min pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduce yourself and your company.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>How do you make money?</li>
<li>What do you need from the person you are pitching?</li>
</ol>


<p>The core of this pitch lies in your company&#8217;s solution to the problem described. Get this wrong and be prepared to entertain a befuddled audience.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to migrate the blog from Wordpress over to a Jekyll/Octopress blogging framework for tech geeks but haven&#8217;t really had the time with my crazy schedules.</p>

<p>And then I realized it doesn&#8217;t actually take too much time to set Octopress up and deploy, especially if you are deploying to Github pages or Heroku.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to migrate from Wordpress as well, here&#8217;s an outline of the steps I took:</p>

<h4>1. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.2+ and Clone Octopress</h4>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
</span><span class='line'>cd octopress</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>2. Install dependencies and install the default Ocotpress theme</h4>

<p>bundle install
rake install</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 3. Export and convert WordPress blog posts you want to migrate ####
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Export WordPress blog entries you want to migrate and use [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) to convert them to markdown.  Put the converted entries into your `source/_posts` folder.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 4. Set up a Github page ####
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>If you want a Github page with subdomain called username/organization, set up a Github repository like `username.github.com` or `organization.github.com`
</span><span class='line'>Next, run Octopress's Github Pages setup:
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake setup_github_pages</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>It will ask you for your Github repository URL so throw in the SSH URL for your Github repository.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 5. Generate the blog and deploy ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake generate
rake deploy</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 6. Commit the source of your blog ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>git add .
git commit -m &#8216;your message&#8217;
git push origin source</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 7. View your blog on local ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake preview
&#8220;`</p>

<h4>8. Set up your custom domain</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave this to you with Octopress&#8217;s own instructions at <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github#custom_domains">Custom Domains</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft&#8217;s announcement that plug ins will not be supported in the METRO version of IE10 can be important news, depending on whether or not you believe that METRO will be the UI of the future. The desktop view version of IE10 will
continue to support Flash.</p>

<p>According to their research, 62% of video sites have some form of HTML5 fallback, however we can still be quite sure that a large percentage of sites still use Flash for myriad purposes. One of which is advertising and this will be greatly affected when browsers and devices continuously drops support for Flash, and is likely to happen in the near future judging from recent sentiments. Most advertisements are now done in Flash for the effects that can be created easily using Adobe&#8217;s Flash suite.</p>

<p>The industry will have to step up fast and switch to HTML5 and Javascript for development in the next few years. However, as browsers without plugin support becomes mainstream, I can imagine developers and clients having to spend more time and money on creating both Flash versions and HTML fallback of their
creations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it seems like the end of an era is nigh upon us. Web sites and content that load quickly and isn&#8217;t cumbersome should be the focus. The giants have spoken.</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting on you a long time now, <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_1_release_notes.html">Rails 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>Now now, can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the latest version of <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 in Action</a> and dig my head into Rails 3.1 documentation as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Your job scope requires you to sit behind a huge monitor and bury yourself in code. That basically means you build things, in CODE. And what the code renders, is ART. Interactive art and possibly the most modern, most advanced art form.</p>

<p>As developers, we need to be very talkative about the project we are working on.</p>

<h3>Talk to relevant stakeholders.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your client, your managers, your peers, tell them what you are doing, solicit feedback.</li>
<li>Tell them your vision.</li>
<li>Tell them what you think would work or won&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait till the end to start talking.</li>
<li>Keep communicating. Keep telling.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Talk to other developers.</h3>

<p>Again, tell them what you are doing.
* What technology you are using.
* What language?
* What kind of workflow?
* What have you learned?
* What insights do others have to help improve on the project?</p>

<p>Talk.</p>

<h3>Talk to the public.</h3>

<p>You are Working on an amazing thing. Share what you are doing. Do a show n tell and mostly show how much you love the art you produced.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you love it?</li>
<li>Was it the process?</li>
<li>The experimental technology you used?</li>
<li>The people/brand/product behind it?</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t be a cubicle drone developer. Be a show and tell developer.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unproductive meetings as we know suck up the souls of productive beings. We should always make sure that if we held meetings, they should be meaningful and have a purpose for everyone present. Else, it is way better to drop notes to the other parties and have them read it.</p>

<blockquote><p>No, we do not understand better by talking face to face with each other unless we want to know how each other is feeling about something, or there is
something that needs to be shown.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, most meetings are poisonous. It is usually productive time loss of about 30mins to an hour x the number of people in the meeting. So it is always important to think about how important a meeting is.</p>

<p>So before you send out the meeting invite:</p>

<h3>What is it that you want to accomplish in the meeting?</h3>

<p>What is this meeting about? Does everyone know what it is about and why they are at the meeting? Does everyone know what they should take away from the meeting or how they can contribute to it?</p>

<h3>Is it important enough to take away hours of productive time?</h3>

<p>Meet with only those in the team that absolutely needs to be there. Leave the rest alone. If they only need to know the conclusions to the meeting, drop them a note after.</p>

<blockquote><p>An even better way? Just send them a message.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Can what you want to say be understood easily through writing?</h3>

<p>Just go drop a note to the team in short, concise, simple English. They will appreciate it and if they have a question they just have to sound out back to you. What makes you think they will have questions right on the spot anyway?
If they can&#8217;t even process what you&#8217;ve said with ease, they will just be more confused.</p>

<h3>Can what you say be understood better through illustrations?</h3>

<p>Would it be better if you can screenshot / use illustrations to show what you want to say? Send that along. It helps <strong>100%</strong> and more. People are visual creatures. It is much easier to understand something in visual form. Everyone interprets words their own way. Images are concrete. That is why wireframes
work much better than verbal explanations.</p>

<blockquote><p>Seriously, just keep those meetings to a minimum. Highly productive people will appreciate it.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twitter has launched the “Follow” button.</p>

<p>Using one of our &#8220;favourite&#8221; celebrities as example, clicking on it brings up a pop-up page that allows you to follow a site&#8217;s primary account. (I’m still trying to get the Baby Baby tune out of my head… oh wait… is that girl trying to **** his ear? Damn his twitter page is supposed to be PG!)</p>

<p>The Follow button can and probably will be a new standard button to be used on
campaigns with their dedicated Twitter accounts.</p>

<p>Google’s +1 button is launched as well, which will probably be another standard for digital campaigns and in fact almost most sites will need this due to the possible effects on search ranking.</p>

<p>So now, 5 buttons are important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Twitter Tweet</li>
<li>Twitter Follow</li>
<li>Google +1</li>
<li>Facebook Like</li>
<li>Facebook Recommend</li>
</ol>


<p>Twitter Tweet is important more on a content basis.</p>

<p>Twitter Follow is important for a specific account that belongs to the site. (Campaign account? Brand account?)</p>

<p>Facebook Like/Recommend are pretty well rounded. (Can be for content / site)</p>

<p>Google +1 would be almost everywhere because of effect on search ranking.</p>

<p>What other buttons will come and will future websites be a smorgasbord of all kinds of buttons? I guess for gamers that love Zynga games, that&#8217;ll be a big welcome since they love clicking. Non-stop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google is the perfect example, showing us how difficult it is to get that one product right that will rake in the cash like no tomorrow. Google has developed tons of products as the internet giant it is but its Search and Word Ads are still its main cash cow.</p>

<p>Despite all the innovation one can churn out, it is just that difficult to know what a market would pick up on at a certain time. What I mean to say is that getting that right product fit actually requires a percentage of luck.</p>

<p>Whether you are using the lean startup methodology or the stealth mode mega-launch, the element of luck is there. Lean startup probably helps make sure you at least have a product that someone will be using, but it definitely cannot guarantee that you will grow big.</p>

<p>No one can know for sure what the next big thing is. But like poker, in the lottery of tech startups you just gotta start building for that ticket. Being good multiplies your chances of course.</p>
