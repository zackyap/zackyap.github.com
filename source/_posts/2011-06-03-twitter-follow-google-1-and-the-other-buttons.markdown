Twitter has launched the “Follow” button.

Using one of our "favourite" celebrities as example, clicking on it brings up a pop-up page that allows you to follow a site's primary account. (I’m still trying to get the Baby Baby tune out of my head… oh wait… is that girl trying to **** his ear? Damn his twitter page is supposed to be PG!)

The Follow button can and probably will be a new standard button to be used on
campaigns with their dedicated Twitter accounts.

Google’s +1 button is launched as well, which will probably be another standard for digital campaigns and in fact almost most sites will need this due to the possible effects on search ranking.

So now, 5 buttons are important:

  1. Twitter Tweet
  2. Twitter Follow
  3. Google +1
  4. Facebook Like
  5. Facebook Recommend
  
Twitter Tweet is important more on a content basis.

Twitter Follow is important for a specific account that belongs to the site. (Campaign account? Brand account?)

Facebook Like/Recommend are pretty well rounded. (Can be for content / site)

Google +1 would be almost everywhere because of effect on search ranking.

  
What other buttons will come and will future websites be a smorgasbord of all kinds of buttons? I guess for gamers that love Zynga games, that'll be a big welcome since they love clicking. Non-stop.
