    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have seen the value of Likes from the S1 filing of Facebook just last week. Facebook has built a multibillion dollar business by understanding what their users say they like, but more importantly they have incorporated Verbs in order to add more context to their users' status updates.</p>

<p>The reason for them doing this is simple really. You can talk about what you Like and think all day but it simply doesn't mean you will act on it. What is a much better indicator of possible behavior is a user's prior behavior. Being able to understand the context of what users are doing will allow advertisers to target users even more accurately.</p>

<p>That is because if you listen to a certain type of music or watch a certain genre of movies frequently, chances are high that you would listen to the same type of music or watch the same genre of movie. Same goes for most lifestyle activities we engage in. Personal preferences are best understood through past behavior.</p>

<p>Activity tracking will be the future and privacy will be compromised. However, in a web system where the social layer drives increasing amount of activity, it is bound to happen.</p>

<p>Activity tracking is not entirely a bad thing however because it provides metrics that provide deeper insights into human behavior and will help us make progress as a species.</p>

<p>In fact, if we are able to create a gamified tracking system that intrinsically rewards users, we will be able to solve much bigger real world problems together.</p>
