<h3>Naming is a bitch</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve found a name for our product but the process of naming a startup in this day and age is crazy tough especially if you are on the web. I&#8217;m not talking about a player scoring 40 points in one NBA game kind of tough. I&#8217;m talking about a player scoring 80 points in one game kind of tough. There are a few well known reasons for this and that includes the need to get the following (in order of importance):</p>

<ol>
<li>Domain Name (that is preferably .com)</li>
<li>Twitter and Facebook</li>
<li>Other social media account namespaces</li>
</ol>


<h3>Head Bang!</h3>

<p>While looking for a good name for our product, we were banging our heads on walls at first, randomly plucking names from thin air that we thought matched what we were doing. During this time, we used name.com, godaddy.com and namecheap.com to check domain availability.</p>

<p>Many hours were lost on the fact that we wanted to settle with a name that all 3 co-founders would share an affinity to. We wanted to make sure that we would all love it and infuse the name with our heart, soul and personality.</p>

<h3>Read these for a better name</h3>

<p>We decided that we needed more help, so we went through a number of resources that would give us insights into good names for modern startups:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.quora.com/How-did-DAngelo-and-Cheever-come-up-with-the-name-Quora">How did D&#8217;Angelo and Cheever come up with the name Quora?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hopperanddropper.com/syllables-scrabble-letters-and-picking-brand-names/">Syllables, Scrabble Letters, and Picking Brand Names</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/05/startup-names/">How Today’s Hottest Startups Got Their Names</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/17702/17-Mutable-Suggestions-For-Naming-A-Startup.aspx">17 Mutable Suggestions For Naming A Startup</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/naming-startup.html">Naming your startup: Settle down, it’s cool!</a></li>
</ol>


<h3>Another Round?</h3>

<p>And so we tried again and on our second round, we started with some criteria that&#8217;d we&#8217;d like to have for THE name. The name should be</p>

<ol>
<li>2 or 3 syllables</li>
<li>Spellable</li>
<li>Not commonly used by a well known company</li>
<li>Makes sense for our product</li>
</ol>


<p>We didn&#8217;t mind made up words and we started using our list of culture and product description words to try to come up with more names whether made up or not.</p>

<h3>Namestation.com</h3>

<p>A tool that really made things easy was <a href="http://www.namestation.com">Namestation.com</a>. It has various ways to help you brainstorm for names including adding popular prefixes and suffixes, combining words in customizes lists, blending words from custom lists with top 1000 keywords, alliterations and many others. On top of that, it does domain checking for each name which cut down the time and effort needed by another 20%. I highly recommend startups to check it out if you are having trouble finding a name.</p>

<h3>X-Factor</h3>

<p>The final step of our naming equation was a Reality TV type game where we were the Startup Name X-Factor judges. Through the help of NameStation, we created a master list of over 500 names together with our original list and we put the list of names into a Google Docs worksheet. We would then give an X each for names we would like to pass. To stay on the list, the name needed at least 2 votes based on our judgement using the criteria we listed. We did 3 rounds to cut the list down to the Final 10 before we discussed the pros and cons of each and finally picking the one we all loved.</p>

<p>That was a mega rant of our naming process.</p>

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<blockquote><h4>Recommended Steps to Find a Name</h4>

<ol>
<li>Read the posts listed above</li>
<li>Pick criteria for the name</li>
<li>Use a tool like <a href="http://www.namestation.com">NameStation.com</a> to brainstorm and generate names</li>
<li>Use a voting system to cut the list down according to criteria picked</li>
<li>Talk through the final list</li>
<li>You have a name. Congrats!</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Met a friend who&#8217;s been running a business for awhile. He looked at me and said, &#8220;Heard you&#8217;re doing a startup for the first time. Congratulations, but be warned that the first year will be all about self discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is now my 4th day of working on my startup full time and I get what he&#8217;s talking about. It probably won&#8217;t be just a one year thing.</p>

<p>Nothing you have ever done will prepare you as a first time founder for the amount of introspection and self reflection you will do because you are constantly making decisions. And you&#8217;d be lying if you say you always know you are making the best choice.</p>

<p>That is probably why so many of us turn to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and other startup blogs to seek crowdsourced wisdom from people who think they&#8217;ve got it right.</p>

<p>The truth is that we will almost never have a damned clue over whether our decisions are the best but we can definitely wish that they lead to the best outcome.</p>

<p>What we can do for ourselves is to make decisions in a lean and agile manner just like how we want to run our startups. Early on, make decisions based on your hunch and keep iterating depending on the results.</p>

<p>Be flexible and be smart about it. We are in the school of hard knocks and there&#8217;s no way around getting hurt in the process of starting a company. We just need to keep optimizing and learning.</p>

<p>Good game and good luck.</p>

<p>I have been asking around for why people use foursquare and it is becoming increasingly apparent that game mechanics involving points, badges and mayorship are not the features that keep people checking in.</p>

<p>People are checking in as a show of social status. It shows that they are doing something interesting somewhere. A check in is thus inherently social without the need for badges, mayorship or points.</p>

<p>This is also true for all other social products as the social web is essentially breeding a popularity contest. How many Likes will I get? How many followers do I have? How many people are going to reblog my post? How many karma points will I get?</p>

<p>What people are concerned about on the social web is their social status. The question they are asking can be simplified as &#8220;Do people like me?&#8221;</p>

<p>If you can build product that helps people get to a &#8220;Yes!&#8221; for the question above, congratulations! You have an addictive and viral product.</p>

<p>We have seen the value of Likes from the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1813364/inside-facebook-si-ipo-filing-845-million-users-37-billion-in-revenues-in-2011">S1 filing of Facebook</a> just last week. Facebook has built a multibillion dollar business by understanding what their users say they like, but more importantly they have incorporated <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/">Verbs</a> in order to add more context to their users&#8217; status updates.</p>

<p>The reason for them doing this is simple really. You can talk about what you Like and think all day but it simply doesn&#8217;t mean you will act on it. What is a much better indicator of possible behavior is a user&#8217;s prior behavior. Being able to understand the context of what users are doing will allow advertisers to target users even more accurately.</p>

<p>That is because if you listen to a certain type of music or watch a certain genre of movies frequently, chances are high that you would listen to the same type of music or watch the same genre of movie. Same goes for most lifestyle activities we engage in. Personal preferences are best understood through past behavior.</p>

<p>Activity tracking will be the future and privacy will be compromised. However, in a web eco-system where the social layer drives increasing amount of activity, it is bound to happen.</p>

<p>Activity tracking is not entirely a bad thing however because it provides metrics that provide deeper insights into human behavior and will help us make progress as a species.</p>

<p>In fact, if we are able to create a gamified tracking system that intrinsically rewards users, we will be able to solve much bigger real world problems together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People have often advocated starting a new business during my own free time while I&#8217;m holding a full time job before jumping into it. Sure, it means stability and lower risks since I would probably be able to determine whether the business idea will work out.</p>

<p>However, the fact is that a very important aspect of building a good business is actually the founders&#8217; ability to maintain a laser sharp focus on their vision and being able to execute the steps required to reach that vision.</p>

<p>Flow is a state of extremely high focus during an activity and it takes time to get into that state. Every time we switch from one activity to another, we break the flow and our productivity takes a huge beating. Activities that require high focus should be done with as little disturbance as possible.</p>

<p>A day job acts as a daily disturbance to an activity you should be fully committed to and focused on. While holding a day job now, I spend 3 hours a day traveling and 9 hours at the office (sometimes more). That is a total of 12+ hours a day spent not working on my product. Most of my energy get expended during those 12 hours as well and I reach home battered and depleted.</p>

<p>How can I convince the world that I believe in my vision if I am unwilling to dive into it and place my full commitment and focus on the business?</p>

<p>If you are starting a business right now while also working a full time job, stop kidding yourself. You are moving much slower than you should be.</p>

<p>MPAA should stop being such a troll. Isn&#8217;t this what SOPA / PIPA was for? So big organizations can silence people but no one can silence the big organizations?</p>

<p>Hacking major sites like yours may not be the best course of action but it has certainly shown the double standards.</p>

<h4>Full Statement from the MPAA:</h4>

<p>&#8220;Our website and many others, including the Department of Justice, were attacked today and the hacker group Anonymous is claiming responsibility for the attacks. We are working with law enforcement authorities to identify those responsible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some groups believe that speech or ideas that they disagree with should be silenced. This could not be more wrong. No matter the point of view, everyone has a right to be heard.</p>

<p>The motion picture and television industry has always been a strong supporter of free speech. We strongly condemn any attempts to silence any groups or individuals.</p>

<p>The Internet is home to creativity, innovation and free speech. We want to keep it that way. Protecting copyrights and protecting free speech go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reflection is the first step for improvement. Without spending time to figure out what to learn and improve on, we fall into the danger of stagnation. This may come a little late but it must be done. Let&#8217;s take a look back at my 2011.</p>

<h3>1. Toy with idea of Gamification</h3>

<p>It was the beginning of a new year. Being an RPG lover, I started imagining living my life as if it was an RPG, gaining levels while completing quests and achievements.</p>

<p>I was sure it was a novel idea but some research proved that it was not. SCVNGR was the biggest real life Gamification service at that time.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I wanted to marry Gamification with instagram&#8217;s stickiness as an app. Sourcing for funding was a tough matter at that time and I was unsure how to move the idea forward. It probably sucked anyway, as all who have experience in tech startups would tell you about your initial idea.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: Fund raising is a difficult process for early stage ideas and first time founders. Get a working prototype out!</p>

<h3>2. Account executive work</h3>

<p>I continued my work as an account executive and learned a lot about customer service and project management, though project management was mostly planning what the client wanted.</p>

<p>During this time, I also discovered my love for coding as I made amendments to my developers&#8217; code due to tight timelines.</p>

<p>I loved building things. I knew this subconsciously but I was afraid of failing as I never had prior experience, but I took my first step towards development by asking for a switch of department.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: If you want something, dare to ask for it. If you never take that step, no one can help you get what you want.</p>

<h3>3. Hunger to be a web developer</h3>

<p>I was filled with the hunger to develop for the web and devoured knowledge of HTML5 &amp; CSS3 like a famished vulture. I began picking up jQuery for how easy it was to add interaction to sites and I slowly transitioned into the role of a web developer.</p>

<p>I had little time to sleep as I juggled the extra load of learning but I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: Coding is a creative and iterative process. It takes awhile to get the code right sometimes but the winning sensation is immensely gratifying.</p>

<p>Also, coder&#8217;s block is extremely dangerous and causes me to visit Hacker News more times than I should.</p>

<h3>4. Founder Institute</h3>

<p>During the last quarter of 2011, I received news that I got accepted into Fall 2011&#8217;s SG FI batch. I jumped on the opportunity with only the slightest of hesitation. (ok, just a bit of research on Quora before I paid the course fees.)</p>

<p>Q4 of 2011 would prove to be the toughest period of 2011 for me as I juggled the course schedule, the assignments and an intensive work schedule on my day job doing web development. Few hours of sleep with lots of late night discussions, brainstorming and coding became the norm.</p>

<p>It is paying off now as I am about to start working on Questified full time, taking the full plunge into entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Founder Institute has been the forceful helping hand that&#8217;s pushing my non-functioning aircraft off the edge. I am all ready to start the sprint to make sure the air craft can fly before it hits the ground.</p>

<h3>Social as a layer</h3>

<p>There has been debate about whether we are at the peak of the social web due to the saturation of social usage.</p>

<p>The truth is that those who think there will be a peak and a slump do not understand social for what it is. As the Zuck would put it: Social is not an app, it is a layer upon the web.</p>

<p>Sure, the web can be served as it is, but social makes it better in a way that is natural to human tendencies and delight. It feeds on mankind&#8217;s tendencies to share things that interests them, thus the power of the &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Tweet&#8221; buttons. People don&#8217;t need to think about it. It is part of who they are.</p>

<p>A layer doesn&#8217;t make people think. If you are a good designer, you know how important it is to not make users think.</p>

<h3>Gamification as a layer</h3>

<p>I am a web developer and web development is a gamified process where I turn my vision or a mock up into a site. I code it, I click refresh in anticipation of the results and I get to see whether the results match my intended goal. There is constant feedback on my efforts through the refresh button, allowing me to fail and succeed rapidly until I reach the final goal.</p>

<p>And this process is a natural part of the human psych. When we participate in activities we are interested in, we have goals we want to meet, usually related to the mastery of the subject. The best way to meet the goals is to work on it by breaking down the steps into measurable tasks and obtaining feedback on your performance as you complete each task.</p>

<p>A game is defined by 4 traits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
<li>Voluntary Participation</li>
</ol>


<p>It may not be obvious but our life is like a game. We make multiple interesting decisions everyday in order to reach our goals and there are rules that create boundaries to what we can or cannot do to reach them. However, we fail see our lives as game like because of the lack of something that connects the dots for us. Most parts of our lives, we go through them without systematic feedback on our decisions and actions.</p>

<p>Gamification will help solve this lack of feedback. Gamification will be a layer upon our lives and it will be natural to us humans without us having to think about it.</p>

<p>P.S. I don&#8217;t like the word gamification either but the industry seems to have settled on it as the defacto term.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Always be prepared with 3 elevator pitch for your startup.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the lesson I learned just 2 days ago. For the past month, I&#8217;ve prepared myself with 2 elevator pitches, one structured to be generic and lasted at most 30s and the other structured to be more specific, with more detail on what the startup actually does and would last from 3 - 5 mins.</p>

<p>When I was asked to give an impromptu 1 min pitch, I was stumped. I went up and tried to fit in as much detail as I could from the longer pitch but I ran over time and what I managed to ramble turned out to be incoherent because I didn&#8217;t manage to get to the point within the minute. That made me realize the importance of the 1 min pitch that I was not prepared for.</p>

<p>I will first outline the 2 pitches I was prepared for:</p>

<ol>
<li>The 30s pitch</li>
<li>The 3-5min pitch</li>
</ol>


<h3>The 30s Elevator Pitch</h3>

<p>The usage of this pitch is pretty clear and straightforward. It&#8217;s for occasions when you have a chance to introduce yourself and what you do but have very limited time with the person you are pitching.</p>

<p>This pitch will be generic but should generate enough interest so the person you pitch is willing to follow up or at the very least, try your product.</p>

<p>The best guide for this I have come across is Adeo Ressi&#8217;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/16447520">Madlibs for Pitching</a> and this is the template to follow:</p>

<p>My company, (company name)<br/>
is developing (a defined offering)<br/>
to help (a target audience)<br/>
(solve a problem)<br/>
(with secret sauce)</p>

<p>Fill in the above and you have a pitch fit for anywhere between 20s to 30s.</p>

<h3>The 3 - 5 min Pitch</h3>

<p>This pitch will require much more detail. And this is the structure that I followed to create my pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start off with an introduction of yourself and the 30s pitch.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Talk about your target market and why they will use your solution.</li>
<li>Talk about your competitors and how you will differentiate.</li>
<li>Talk about your revenue model.</li>
<li>Talk about your team and why your team is the best fit to do this.</li>
<li>Talk about what phase you are in and what you need. (eg. Funding? Advice?)</li>
</ol>


<p>There will be quite an amount of detail that you should have done thorough research on, and these are important details that people need to know in order to be truly interested in your business whether they are investors or potential employees. Make sure you know all these information at the tip of your fingers.</p>

<h3>The 1 min Pitch</h3>

<p>There will be times when you will need to give details of your business so that the main points of the business gets across but you have limited time to impress.</p>

<p>This is where the 1 min pitch comes in. Time to put your tweeting skills to use. Be interesting and be concise. Your main goal here is to solicit comments and feedback on top of building interest in what you do.</p>

<p>What does the person you are pitching absolutely has to know in order to understand enough of your business to be able to give valuable feedback?</p>

<p>Here is the structure that I followed to create my 1 min pitch:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduce yourself and your company.</li>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>Explain what your company does to solve the problem.</li>
<li>How do you make money?</li>
<li>What do you need from the person you are pitching?</li>
</ol>


<p>The core of this pitch lies in your company&#8217;s solution to the problem described. Get this wrong and be prepared to entertain a befuddled audience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111207-p8sni6h2eyyac4dg65wpmpahx8.jpg" alt="Zack's Quest" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to migrate the blog from Wordpress over to a Jekyll/Octopress blogging framework for tech geeks but haven&#8217;t really had the time with my crazy schedules.</p>

<p>And then I realized it doesn&#8217;t actually take too much time to set Octopress up and deploy, especially if you are deploying to Github pages or Heroku.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to migrate from Wordpress as well, here&#8217;s an outline of the steps I took:</p>

<h4>1. Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.2+ and Clone Octopress</h4>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
</span><span class='line'>cd octopress</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>2. Install dependencies and install the default Ocotpress theme</h4>

<p>bundle install
rake install</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 3. Export and convert WordPress blog posts you want to migrate ####
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Export WordPress blog entries you want to migrate and use [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) to convert them to markdown.  Put the converted entries into your `source/_posts` folder.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 4. Set up a Github page ####
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>If you want a Github page with subdomain called username/organization, set up a Github repository like `username.github.com` or `organization.github.com`
</span><span class='line'>Next, run Octopress's Github Pages setup:
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake setup_github_pages</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>It will ask you for your Github repository URL so throw in the SSH URL for your Github repository.
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 5. Generate the blog and deploy ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake generate
rake deploy</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 6. Commit the source of your blog ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>git add .
git commit -m &#8216;your message&#8217;
git push origin source</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#### 7. View your blog on local ####
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>rake preview
&#8220;`</p>

<h4>8. Set up your custom domain</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave this to you with Octopress&#8217;s own instructions at <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github#custom_domains">Custom Domains</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
