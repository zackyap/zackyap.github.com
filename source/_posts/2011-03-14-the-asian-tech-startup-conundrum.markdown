Today, I read a tweet by [Jason Ong](http://twitter.com/jasonong) Singapore
Ruby Brigade. He questioned his friend on why he didn't pursue starting up a
promising idea. His friends answer was : "can't get thru arguing with parents"

I think that this is a very real issue in an Asian context especially. The
importance of family has been embroiled from young and filial piety is of
utmost importance. Thus, it is more often than not that parents, even at our
modern age, hold big influence on the things we do.

The Asian parents are not unlike those from many other cultures who have
slogged their whole lives just so that their family can lead comfortable
lives. Those were times when nations were being built and fighting for
survival meant more than building empires.

Times have changed but the Asian parents' minds haven't. They still want
stable jobs for their kids and thus the best paying jobs like doctors, lawyers
and bankers are seen as the best careers to pursue. Entrepreneurship is too
risky, especially so in a society that does not accept any form of failure.
This concept is proven true by the education systems employed.

Of course, there are also a number of other discouraging factors:

  1. There are very few high profile large figure exits that have happened in the region. It might be harder to convince the family the worth of the risk vs the reward.
  2. Pushing beyond the early adopters in the region is comparatively harder. There is a smaller market of early adopters and making early stage survival a tough fight. The rapid take up rate of smartphones might change this however, as apps are easily accessible.
  3. Everyone else in society doesn't believe in the path of entrepreneurship. When holding a conversation with an extended family member or their friends and they ask you what you do, if you answer with a full time job where you work hard day and night, they nod their heads with approval that you have found a stable job and are now set for life. If you answered excitedly that you are an entrepreneur and that you are building the next big thing, they'd likely experience a fluster and a frantic moment hiding their disapproval and wondering how not to look like they are in absolute horror. To the Asian society, being an entrepreneur can almost equate to one not doing any work, or being out of work. In a society where "face" is of utmost importance, it becomes all the more difficult. Parents want the easy way out. They want to tell their friends and family that their son/daughter is holding a well paying job.
That said, it becomes even more apparent that Asian entrepreneurs have to be a
special breed of rebels and revolutionaries who can break past all the
difficulties placed to stop them in their tracks.

With enough hunger, I am sure that it is possible to break past "The Parent
Trap".
