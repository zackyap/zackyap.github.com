Hello there!

I've been waiting on you a long time now, [Rails
3.1](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_1_release_notes.html).

Now now, can't wait to get my hands on the latest version of [Rails 3 in
Action](http://www.manning.com/katz/)Â and dig my head into Rails 3.1
documentation as well.

I guess my plan to complete Dragon Age : Origins is in ashes.
